### Key Goals
- Build a robust resume parsing system that handles diverse resume formats
- Implement AI-driven data extraction with high accuracy
- Create RESTful APIs that integrate seamlessly with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)
- Demonstrate scalability and performance optimization
- Ensure data privacy and security compliance

### Innovation Focus Areas
- Advanced AI/ML techniques for document processing
- Context-aware information extraction
- Multi-format support (PDF, DOCX, TXT, images)
- Real-time processing capabilities
- Integration with modern HR tech stacks

## Challenge Description

### Problem Statement
Traditional resume parsing systems struggle with:
- **Format Variability**: Diverse resume layouts, fonts, and structures
- **Context Understanding**: Difficulty interpreting implied information and context
- **Accuracy Issues**: Misclassification of skills, experience levels, and qualifications
- **Scalability Challenges**: Poor performance with high-volume processing
- **Integration Complexity**: Difficulty integrating with existing HR systems

### Solution Requirements
Participants must develop an intelligent resume parser that:
1. **Accurately extracts** structured data from unstructured resume documents
2. **Handles multiple formats** including PDF, DOCX, TXT, and scanned images (OCR)
3. **Uses AI/ML techniques** for context-aware parsing and data enhancement
4. **Provides RESTful APIs** for seamless integration
5. **Demonstrates scalability** for enterprise-level usage

## Testing Framework

### Automated Evaluation Process

#### Phase 1: Automated API Testing (Run continuously during hackathon)
1. **Health Check Tests**: Verify API availability
2. **Functional Tests**: Test all required endpoints
3. **Performance Tests**: Measure response times and throughput
4. **Security Tests**: Validate file upload security and authentication

#### Phase 2: Accuracy Testing (Final evaluation)
1. **Ground Truth Dataset**: 100 manually verified resumes
2. **Field-by-Field Comparison**: Measure extraction accuracy
3. **Job Matching Validation**: Test relevancy scoring against known good matches
4. **Edge Case Testing**: Handle unusual resume formats
5. **AI Enhancement Validation**: Verify AI-generated insights

#### Phase 3: Manual Review (Final judging)
1. **Code Quality Review**: Architecture, documentation, best practices
2. **Innovation Assessment**: Unique features and creative solutions
3. **Presentation Evaluation**: Demo quality and problem explanation

### Testing Tools and Automation
- **API Testing**: Newman (Postman CLI) for automated API testing
